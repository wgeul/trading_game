Trading Game

Your Goal and Measurement

You are a team of fund managers managing a fund with AUM of $1,000,000. Pick a name for your fund.  For inspirations, go to  http://www.hedgefundnamegenerator.com/.  You manage the portfolios for your clients over the next 6 week trading period. This period begins on Monday, 15 January 2018, and continues through to Friday, 23 February 2018.  You don`t need to liquidate your portfolio at the end of the trading game. 
The clients of the fund have specified capital appreciation as the main investment objective and have no short-term cash needs. Your challenge will be to design and execute an investment strategy that satisfies the client over the 6 week investment period. Your grade for this project is based on both the performance of the portfolio and a report. Each team will be responsible for the following:
•	Articulating the investment objective. Besides the performance investment objective, you can also target clients who have other specific requirements, e.g.  Socially responsible investment   
•	Choosing the benchmark according to your investment objectives
•	Formulating an appropriate investment strategy to meet the objectives
•	Conducting the necessary research
•	Selecting the appropriate securities and executing trades. Note that you can only execute 300 trades during this period. Use them wisely. 
•	 Track the daily performance of your portfolio and your benchmark index  
•	Rebalancing the portfolio when necessary. 
•	If you decide you want to change your strategy, you must justify your decisions

Final Stock-Trak Report and Presentation

Your clients are also evaluating other portfolio managers, all of whom happen to be in the FEM11075 class (amazing coincidence).  At the end of the 6-week trial period, they plan to host a conference meeting with the fund managers.  Each team has 20 minutes to show that they have the true skills to generate the best risk adjusted return.  The best performing funds need to prove that their performance is due to skills rather than luck. The funds that do not perform well can show that the funds have the sound strategies to produce best long term returns. The clients will decide which teams of fund managers have the true skills and have their final pick of the funds to continue managing their money.  

The short report should be no more than 5 pages (including Tables).
Deadline: Tuesday Feb 27, 9:00

 Grading:
 
Your grade of the trading game depends on two parts.

1.	Performance based grade
The performance grade presents the financial compensation the fund managers would receive, which is often 1% of AUM for mutual funds.  The AUM will be the final portfolio value based on the closing prices on 23rd February 2018.  

 The following table matches the grades with the range of the management fee. The performance grade accounts for 5% of the total grade. 


Fees	Grades
20,000 and  above 	10
15,000-19,999	9
12,000-14,999         	8
10,000-11,999	7.5
9,000   -9,999	6.5
8,000-8,999	5.5
Below 8,000	5 


2.	Report based grade

The report grade accounts for another 15% of the total grade. It depends on the following. 
•	Do you have clearly defined investment objectives?
•	Are the investment strategies you took appropriate for your clients given the investment objectives and target risk/return goals that you selected?
•	What specific steps did you take during the trading period to attempt to adjust your portfolio to better achieve your target? How successful were these steps?
•	Do you apply what you have learned through the class in your portfolio management?   
•	Do you follow the trading rules (number of trades, choice of benchmark, use of cash, tracking your performance)?





Have fun investing!
